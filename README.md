# Oasis_Travel
This makeshift website, goes through the motions of certain payment features that I wish the Airbnb website had.

Motivation
___________________________________________________________
The motivation behind this practice project creation was because I was not getting paid back in a timely manner by friends when putting Airbnb charges on my own credit card. 
One of the features that would have made my life easier would have been having the option of choosing a payment-split, and for other people paying in Bitcoin. This payment-split would allow you to split the price with other payees to make transactions easy and seemless. You would select an agreed portion of the payment that you yourself would pay, then by email, the other payees would complete the transaction to finalize the booking process for the selected property that your group agreed upon. The entire party would have 48 hours to complete the payment before the hold on the property expires. This would elimate the hassels of collecting money from friends.

Tech/Framework Used
