# Oasis_Travel
___________________________________________________________
This makeshift website which does not have any back-end code installed, goes throught the motions of certain features that in my opinion the Airbnb website is lacking.

Motivation
___________________________________________________________
The motivation behind this practice project creation was because I was not getting paid back in a timely manner by friends when putting Airbnb charges on my own credit card. 
One of the features that would have made my life easier would have been having the option of choosing a payment-split. This would allow you to split the price with other payees to make transactions easy and seemless. You would select an agreed portion of the payment that you yourself would pay, then by email, the other payees would complete the transaction to finalize the booking process for the selected property that your group agreed upon. The entire party would have 48 hours to complete the payment before the hold on the property expires. This would elimate the hassels such as receiving money late, or not money at all from friends.

Tech/Framework Used
