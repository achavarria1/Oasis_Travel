### Project title
-----------------------

This makeshift website, goes through the motions of certain payment features that I wish the Airbnb website had such as a payment-split to divide the costs between friends.

### Motivation
--------------------

The motivation behind this practice project creation was because I was not getting paid back in a timely manner by friends when putting Airbnb charges on my own credit card. 
One of the features that would have made my life easier would have been having the option of choosing a payment-split. This payment-split would allow you to split the price with other payees to make transactions easy and seemless. You would select an agreed portion of the payment that you yourself would pay, then by email, the other payees would complete the transaction to finalize the booking process for a selected property. The entire party would have 48 hours to complete the payment before the hold on the property expires. This would elimate the hassels of collecting money from friends later on.

Other features for the Airbnb website that it could benefit from would be having a restuarant locator, a rideshare integration and a enviromentally freindly homes that customers could choose from. Although I did not write the code for the full intregration of these features on my site, I customzied a section that includes icons and what this could also look like for a customer.
